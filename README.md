# Blog App

This is a blog app built using React, TypeScript, and several other technologies. The app allows users to create and publish blog posts, and it includes the following features:

- Email Integration: The app uses EmailJS to connect with an email service and send emails.
- State Management: React Context is a built-in feature of React that enables the sharing of state data across the component tree without the need for prop drilling.
- Firebase Authentication: Users can log in to the app using their Gmail accounts, thanks to Firebase authentication.
- Footer Icons: The component utilizes React Icons, a library of popular icons as React components, for stylish and visually appealing footer icons.
- Styling with Tailwind CSS: The user interface is designed using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for streamlined and responsive styling.
- TypeScript: The entire app is built using TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides better developer tooling.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- EmailJS: A service for sending emails using JavaScript.
- Firebase: A mobile and web application development platform with various features, including authentication.
- React Icons: A collection of popular icons as React components.
